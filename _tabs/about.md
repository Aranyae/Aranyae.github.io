I'm Luca, a.k.a. Aranyae. I'm a cybersecurity student, currently specializing in offensive security and pentesting. This is my tiny and cozy nook of the internet, where I'll post snippets of my journey through the cybersecurity world and reports of the various VMs and challenges I'll solve, primarily on [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.com/home/users/profile/137669).

The main objective of this blog is training my reporting skills and helping me learn faster by writing my notes and ideas in a more structured format. 
Similarly, I hope it can be useful to newcomers and students like myself due to my posts being focused on the whole trial and error process with lots of brainstorming. Sometimes another perspective is all that's needed to clear your mind and finally reach a solution! 

Finally, feel free to contact me on my socials if you have any question or suggestion.

Cheers!
